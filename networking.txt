Network Devices

Router to connect two or more networks e.g. LAN or MAN

Switches to connect two or more devices in an network e.g. LAN

OSI Model
Application Layer
-protocols like http,smtp ftp transfer data streams

Presentation Layer
-it helps in presenting the data packets and supports interoperability

Session Layer
-interhost connection is established in this layer

Transport Layer
-message segmentation its transmission and maintains end to end connection using TCP (3 way handshake) & UDP

Network Layer 
-Data delivery using routers  using ospf (open shortest path first),bgp (border gateway protocol) & IS-IS (Intermediate system to intermediate system)

Data Link Layer
-access to media like network card

Physical Layer
-binary transmission using cables or wireless mediums

IPv4
Internet address of 32Bits Octets for hosts  
Unicast:S
Class A (0) range 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255    8NetworkBits 24HostBits  Private 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Class B (10) range 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255    16N 16H  Private 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
Class C (110) range 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255    24N 8H  Private 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
Multicast:
Class D (1110) range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Class E (1111) range 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Directed Broadcast Address
used for DdoS (smurf)
host sends data to all devices in network 

Local Broadcast Address
255.255.255.255 is dropped by routers manual dhcp frwrding or dhcp relay configuratiion required
DHCP Server
Provides IP addresses dynamically to network devices

CIDR classless Inter-domain routing
way to represt the subnet mask 124.255.255.255/8 = 255.0.0.0
SUBNETTING
METHOD 
1.BINARY 
SUBNET  all host portion with 0's
1ST HOST  all host portion with 0's except last 
LAST HOST all host portion with 1's except last
BROADCAST ADDRESS  all host portion with 1'sx`

2.quick method
128 64  32   16 8    4   2 1
128 192 224 240 252 254  255
NAT (Network Address Translation)

Step 1:check where the subnet doesnt match 255 it where we split  
e.g 172.16.35.123/20 has subnet mask 255.255.[240].0	
Step 2:do the math 240-256 = 16 so difference of 16 between networks 
Step 3:network 1:0 network 2:16 network 3:32  ntwork 4:48
by looking at network we can say the IP address containing 35 falls in network 3 so 
subnet is 172.16.32.0
first host 172.16.32.1
brodcast address is nxt network - 1 so,
172.16.48.0 - 1 which is 172.16.47.255
last host is brodcast address - 1 so,
172.16.47.254

subnetting by network or host
HOST:
step 1 : calculate no. of bits required for hosts  eg. 14 hosts require  2^^4 - 2 = 14 so 4 bits required
step 2 : then the no of bits are added into the subnet from left to right

NETWORK
step 1: suppose we want 30 subnets for as many hosts possible then we require 2^^5 =32 so we take 5 bits
step 2 :then the no. of bits are added as subnet into the mask from right to left

Routing Protocol
EIGRP bandwidth & delay
OSPF bandwidth
RIP hopcount
