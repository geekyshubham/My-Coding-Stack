Network Devices

Router to connect two or more networks e.g. LAN or MAN

Switches to connect two or more devices in an network e.g. LAN

OSI Model
Application Layer
-protocols like http,smtp ftp transfer data streams

Presentation Layer
-it helps in presenting the data packets and supports interoperability

Session Layer
-interhost connection is established in this layer

Transport Layer
-message segmentation its transmission and maintains end to end connection using TCP (3 way handshake) & UDP

Network Layer 
-Data delivery using routers  using ospf (open shortest path first),bgp (border gateway protocol) & IS-IS (Intermediate system to intermediate system)

Data Link Layer
-access to media like network card

Physical Layer
-binary transmission using cables or wireless mediums

TCP/IP

IPv4
Internet address of 32Bits Octets for hosts  
Unicast:
Class A (0) range 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255    8NetworkBits 24HostBits  Private 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
Class B (10) range 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255    16N 16H  Private 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
Class C (110) range 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255    24N 8H  Private 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
Multicast:
Class D (1110) range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Class E (1111) range 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

Directed Broadcast Address
used for DdoS (smurf)
host sends data to all devices in network 

Local Broadcast Address
255.255.255.255 is dropped by routers manual dhcp frwrding or dhcp relay configuratiion required
DHCP Server
Provides IP addresses dynamically to network devices

CIDR classless Inter-domain routing
way to represt the subnet mask 124.255.255.255/8 = 255.0.0.0

NAT (Network Address Translation)
